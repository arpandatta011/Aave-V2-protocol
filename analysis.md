|--------------|-------------------|
| 0â€“100        | 12                |
| 101â€“200      | 29                |
| 201â€“300      | 22                |
| 301â€“400      | 40                |
| 401â€“500      | 54                |
| 501â€“600      | 251               |

## ðŸŸ¥ Behavior of Low-Scoring Wallets (0â€“400)

- Typically have **low or zero repayments**
- Often exhibit **high borrow-to-deposit ratios**
- Some were involved in **liquidation events**
- Showed **short usage duration** and minimal activity
- May reflect **bot-like or high-risk behavior**

---

## ðŸŸ© Behavior of High-Scoring Wallets (700â€“1000)

- Demonstrate **consistent repayments**
- Borrow within responsible limits compared to deposits
- No liquidation activity observed
- Exhibit **longer protocol usage periods**
- High transaction counts indicating **trustworthy activity**

---

## ðŸ“Œ Insights

- Most wallets score between **600â€“700**, indicating moderate trust levels.
- Very few wallets fall into the extreme **low (0â€“100)** or **high (900â€“1000)** score range.
- **Liquidations and over-borrowing** are the top indicators of risk.
- **Good repayment behavior and longevity** significantly improve scores.

## ðŸ“ˆ Suggestions for Improvement

- Incorporate time-weighted features (e.g., recent vs. older transactions).
- Add clustering to identify wallet behavior patterns more robustly.
- Use anomaly detection or supervised ML for fraud/risk prediction if labeled data is available.
